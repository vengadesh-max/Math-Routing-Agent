# Math Routing Agent - Final Proposal

## Executive Summary

The Math Routing Agent is an advanced AI-powered system that replicates a mathematical professor's capabilities through an Agentic-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture. The system intelligently routes between a curated knowledge base and web search to provide comprehensive, step-by-step mathematical solutions while incorporating human feedback for continuous learning.

## 1. Input & Output Guardrails

### Approach Taken

We implemented a comprehensive guardrails system using Pydantic models and custom validation logic:

#### Input Guardrails (`guardrails/input_guardrails.py`)
- **Content Validation**: Filters potentially harmful content using regex patterns
- **Length Validation**: Enforces maximum input length (1000 characters)
- **Mathematical Content Detection**: Uses pattern matching to identify mathematical content
- **Topic Classification**: Automatically categorizes questions into mathematical topics
- **Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters and normalizes input

#### Output Guardrails (`guardrails/output_guardrails.py`)
- **Educational Value Assessment**: Evaluates response quality for educational purposes
- **Mathematical Content Validation**: Ensures responses contain proper mathematical notation
- **Step-by-Step Structure Verification**: Validates presence of required educational elements
- **Content Sanitization**: Removes potentially harmful content from responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates confidence scores based on response quality

### Why This Approach

1. **Security First**: Prevents injection attacks and malicious content
2. **Educational Focus**: Ensures responses maintain educational value
3. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Validates mathematical content and notation
4. **User Safety**: Protects users from inappropriate or incorrect content
5. **Quality Assurance**: Maintains high standards for mathematical explanations

## 2. Knowledge Base - Dataset and Details
